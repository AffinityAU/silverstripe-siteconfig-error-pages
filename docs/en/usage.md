Usage
========================
Once you have [installed](../../README.md#installation) the module you should be good to go, you do not need any special setup. After flushing the manifest you can go to the Settings section in the cms where you should see a new tab called "Error Pages" from here you will see all of the Error Pages on the site.

To edit an error page simply click on the row or click on the edit button at the end of the row. Once there you can manage the error page as you did when it was in the page tree. Adding error pages is as simple as clicking on the "Add Error Page" button.

To restore an error page that was deleted click on the "Include Deleted" button, the list will reload and all of the error pages that were deleted will show with a line through them. To restore them click on the blue arrows at the end of the row.
